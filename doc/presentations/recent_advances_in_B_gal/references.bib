	abstract = {We perform cosmological, hydrodynamic simulations of magnetic fields in galaxy clusters. The computational code combines the special-purpose hardware Grape for calculating gravitational interaction, and smooth-particle hydrodynamics for the gas component. We employ the usual MHD equations for the evolution of the magnetic field in an ideally conducting plasma. As a first application, we focus on the question what kind of initial magnetic fields yield final field configurations within clusters which are compatible with Faradayrotation measurements. Our main results can be summarised as follows: (i) Initial magnetic field strengths are amplified by approximately three orders of magnitude in cluster cores, one order of magnitude above the expectation from spherical collapse, (ii) Vastly different initial field configurations (homogeneous or chaotic) yield results that cannot significantly be distinguished. (iii) Micro-Gauss fields and Faraday-rotation observations are well reproduced in our simulations starting from initial magnetic fields of âˆ¼ 10-9 G strength at redshift 15. Our results show that (i) shear flows in clusters are crucial for amplifying magnetic fields beyond simple compression, (ii) final field configurations in clusters are dominated by the cluster collapse rather than by the initial configuration, and (iii) initial magnetic fields of order 10-9 G are required to match Faraday-rotation observations in real clusters.},
